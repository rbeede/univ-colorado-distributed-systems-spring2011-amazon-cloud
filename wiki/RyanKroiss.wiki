#summary Most frequently used Facebook applications

= Introduction =

My project analyzed a [http://odysseas.calit2.uci.edu/doku.php/public:online_social_networks#facebook_applications data set] from the Networking Group at the University of California - Irvine.  They kindly allowed me to use the data set.

I chose to look at the number of times each application was used within a day over a certain time period.  Some people use this as an indicator of popularity.  Others suggest that this is a poor metric.  Regardless, the results were interesting.  To respect the wishes of the data providers, I will post the code but not the data nor results.
